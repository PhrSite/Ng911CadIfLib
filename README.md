# Introduction
The Ng911CadIfLib is a Microsoft .NET DLL class library that NG9-1-1 PSAP Call Handling Functional Element (CHFE) applications can use to provide conveyance of Emergency Incident Data Objecs (EIDO) to a Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system.

The following standard describes describes the EIDO.

>[NENA Standard for Emergency Incident Data Object (EIDO)](https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.nena.org/resource/resmgr/standards/nena-sta-021.1a_eido_json_20.pdf), NENA, NENA-STA-021.1a-2022, October 19, 2021.

The following block diagram shows the interfaces between the PSAP CHFE, the Ng911CadIfServer class and a CAD System.

This class library provides two classes shown in gray in the above figure that applications can use for the communication of EIDOs.

The Ng911CadIfServer class implements the server-side of the EIDO Web Socket conveyance protocol and the EIDO Retrieval Service interfaces specified in the following standard.

The CadIfWebSocketClient class implements the client-side (i.e., the notifier) of the EIDO conveyance protocol.
