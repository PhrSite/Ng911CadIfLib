# The Ng911CadIfLibDocumentation Project
This is the GitHub Pages documentation project for the Ng911CadIfLib class library.

This is a [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx) project so DocFX must be installed on you system before you can build the documentation GitHub Pages static web site for the Ng911Lib project.

To build the documentation, open a command prompt and change to the the Ng911CadIfLibDocumentation directory and then type docfx.

** Note: The docfx.json configuration file uses a relative path to the Ng911CadIfLib project so the Ng911CadIfLibDocumentation project must be located at the same directory level as the Ng911CadIfLib project. For example, if the Ng911CadIfLib project is located under c:\MyProjects, then the Ng911CadIfLibDocumentation project must also be located under c:\MyProjects.**

The documentation web site on github.io is setup to deploy the static web site when this project is pushed to GitHub. The documentation pages are located at [https://phrsite.github.io/Ng911CadIfLibDocumentation](https://phrsite.github.io/Ng911CadIfLibDocumentation).
